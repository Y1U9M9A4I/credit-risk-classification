## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

    In the current analysis, we create and utilize a Supervised Machine Learning Model for the processing of Crypto-Currency data. This Crypto currency contains data columns loan loan_size,interest_rate,borrower_income,debt_to_income,num_of_accounts,derogatory_marks,total_debt,loan_status. Our aim is to be able to use this model to predict whether an instance would likely be a healthy loan [Class 0] or high-risk loan [Class 1]. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.


# CryptoClustering Assignment 

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report (20 points)
To receive all points, you must:
